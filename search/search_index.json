Tip We provide a check command to run all the tests and analytics, required for a pull request. Run composer check Running the Test Suite While developing, the test part is very important: if you apply a patch to the existing code, the test suite must run without errors or failures and if you add a new functionality, no one will consider it without tests. Our test tool is PhpUnit and we provide a script to launch it: composer test Since our command runs phpunit binary under the hood, you can pass all phpunit options to it via the -- operator, i.e.: composer test -- --stop-on-failure You can also use phpunit directly: vendor/bin/phpunit Code Coverage We provides two commands to generate a code coverage report in html or xml format. composer coverage:html command generates a code coverage report in html format, into the directory coverage/ while composer coverage:clover generates the report in xml format, into clover.xml file. Static Analysis Tool To prevent as many bugs as possible, we use a static analysis tool called Psalm . To launch it, run the following command from the root directory of psr2-code-generator project: composer analytics After its analysis, Psalm outputs errors and issues with its suggestions on how to fix them. Errors are more important and generally more dangerous than issues, anyway you should fix both. Coding Standard We ship our script to easily fix coding standard errors, via php-cs-fixer tool. To fix coding standard errors just run: composer cs-fix and to show the errors without fixing them, run: composer cs If you want to learn more about our code style, see https://github.com/susina/coding-standard .

There are different types of models available which are explained in this section. Structured Generateable Models Structured models are composites and can contain other models. Structured models implement the GenerateableInterface and can be passed to a generator. These are: PhpClass representing a class, with all its methods, properties, comments etc. PhpTrait representing a trait with all its methods, properties etc. PhpInterface representing an interface with all its method signatures, property definitions atc. Part Models Structured models can be composed of various members. Functions and methods can itself contain zero to many parameters. All parts are: PhpConstant representing a constant PhpProperty representing a property PhpMethod representing a method PhpParameter representing a function or method parameter Name vs. Namespace vs. Qualified Name ? There can be a little struggle about the different names, which are name, namespace and qualified name. Every model has a name and generateable models additionally have a namespace and qualified name. The qualified name is a combination of namespace + name. Here is an overview: Name Tool Namespace my\\cool Qualified Name my\\cool\\Tool Create your first Class Let's start with a simple example: <?php use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpClass ; $class = new PhpClass (); $class -> setQualifiedName ( 'my\\\\cool\\\\Tool' ); which will generate an empty class: <?php namespace my\\cool ; class Tool { } Adding a Constructor It's better to have a constructor, so we add one: <?php use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpClass ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpMethod ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpParameter ; // You can pass the name or the qualified name when you instantiate your model $class = new PhpClass ( 'my\\\\cool\\\\Tool' ); $class -> setMethod ( PhpMethod :: create ( '__construct' ) -> addParameter ( PhpParameter :: create ( 'target' ) -> setType ( 'string' ) -> setDescription ( 'Creates my Tool' ) ) ) ; you can see the fluent API in action and the snippet above will generate: <?php namespace my\\cool ; class Tool { /** * @param string $target Creates my Tool */ public function __construct ( string $target ) { } } Adding members We've just learned how to pass a blank method, the constructor to the class. We can also add properties, constants and of course methods. Let's do so: <?php use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpClass ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpMethod ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpParameter ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpProperty ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpConstant ; $class = PhpClass :: create ( 'my\\\\cool\\\\Tool' ) -> setMethod ( PhpMethod :: create ( 'setDriver' ) -> addParameter ( PhpParameter :: create ( 'driver' ) -> setType ( 'string' ) ) -> setType ( 'bool' ) // optional if you want return type -> setBody ( \" \\$ this->driver = \\$ driver; return true;\" ) ) -> setProperty ( PhpProperty :: create ( 'driver' ) -> setVisibility ( 'private' ) -> setType ( 'string' ) ) -> setConstant ( new PhpConstant ( 'FOO' , 'bar' )) ; will generate: <?php namespace my\\cool ; class Tool { /** */ const FOO = 'bar' ; /** * @var string */ private $driver ; /** * * @param string $driver */ public function setDriver ( string $driver ) : bool { $this -> driver = $driver ; return true ; } } Let's add some docblock comments, too: <?php use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpClass ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpMethod ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpParameter ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpProperty ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpConstant ; $class = PhpClass :: create ( 'my\\\\cool\\\\Tool' ) -> setMultilineDescription ([ \"The fantastic Tool class.\" , \"\" , \"@author John Smith\" ]) -> setMethod ( PhpMethod :: create ( 'setDriver' ) -> setDescription ( \"Set the specific driver\" ) -> addParameter ( PhpParameter :: create ( 'driver' ) -> setType ( 'string' ) -> setDescription ( \"The driver\" ) ) -> setType ( 'bool' ) -> setTypeDescription ( \"If everything is ok\" ) -> setBody ( \" \\$ this->driver = \\$ driver; return true;\" ) ) -> setProperty ( PhpProperty :: create ( 'driver' ) -> setVisibility ( 'private' ) -> setType ( 'string' ) -> setDescription ( \"The driver\" ) ) -> setConstant (( new PhpConstant ( 'FOO' , 'bar' )) -> setDescription ( \"The FOO constant\" ) ) ; will generate: <?php namespace my\\cool ; /** * The fantastic Tool class * * @author John Smith */ class Tool { /** * The FOO constant */ const FOO = 'bar' ; /** * The driver * * @var string */ private $driver ; /** * Set the specific driver * * @param string $driver * @return bool If everything is ok */ public function setDriver ( string $driver ) : bool { $this -> driver = $driver ; return true ; } } Declare use statements When you put code inside a method there can be a reference to a class or interface, where you normally put the qualified name into a use statement. So here is how you do it: <?php use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpClass ; use Susina\\Codegen\\Model\\PhpMethod ; $class = new PhpClass (); $class -> setName ( 'Tool' ) -> setNamespace ( 'my\\\\cool' ) -> setMethod ( PhpMethod :: create ( '__construct' ) -> setBody ( '$request = Request::createFromGlobals();' ) ) -> declareUse ( 'Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\Request' ) ; which will create: <?php namespace my\\cool ; use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request ; class Tool { /** */ public function __construct () { $request = Request :: createFromGlobals (); } } Understanding Values The models PhpConstant , PhpParameter and PhpProperty support values; all of them implement the ValueInterface . Each value object has a type, a value (of course) or an expression. There is a difference between values and expressions. Values refer to language primitives ( string , int , float , bool and null ). Additionally you can set a PhpConstant as value (the lib understands this as a library primitive ;-). If you want more complex control over the output, you can set an expression instead, which will be generated as is . Some Examples: <?php PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( 'hello world.' ); // $foo = 'hello world.'; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( 300 ); // $foo = 300; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( 3.14 ); // $foo = 3.14; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( false ); // $foo = false; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( null ); // $foo = null; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( PhpConstant :: create ( 'BAR' )); // $foo = BAR; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setExpression ( 'self::MY_CONST' ); // $foo = self::MY_CONST; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setExpression ( \"['my' => 'array']\" ); // $foo = ['my' => 'array']; For retrieving values there is a hasValue() method which returns true whether there is a value or an expression present. To be sure what is present there is also an isExpression() method which you can use as a second check: <?php if ( $prop -> hasValue ()) { if ( $prop -> isExpression ()) { // do something with an expression } else { // do something with a value } } Much, much more The API has a lot more to offer and has almost full support for what you would expect to manipulate on each model, of course everything is fluent API.","title":"Model"},{"location":"model/#model","text":"A model is a representation of your code, that you can create via the fluent api.

Each value object has a type, a value (of course) or an expression. There is a difference between values and expressions. Values refer to language primitives ( string , int , float , bool and null ). Additionally you can set a PhpConstant as value (the lib understands this as a library primitive ;-). If you want more complex control over the output, you can set an expression instead, which will be generated as is . Some Examples: <?php PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( 'hello world.' ); // $foo = 'hello world.'; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( 300 ); // $foo = 300; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( 3.14 ); // $foo = 3.14; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( false ); // $foo = false; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( null ); // $foo = null; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setValue ( PhpConstant :: create ( 'BAR' )); // $foo = BAR; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setExpression ( 'self::MY_CONST' ); // $foo = self::MY_CONST; PhpProperty :: create ( 'foo' ) -> setExpression ( \"['my' => 'array']\" ); // $foo = ['my' => 'array']; For retrieving values there is a hasValue() method which returns true whether there is a value or an expression present. To be sure what is present there is also an isExpression() method which you can use as a second check: <?php if ( $prop -> hasValue ()) { if ( $prop -> isExpression ()) { // do something with an expression } else { // do something with a value } }","title":"Understanding Values"},{"location":"model/#much-much-more","text":"The API has a lot more to offer and has almost full support for what you would expect to manipulate on each model, of course everything is fluent API.","title":"Much, much more"},{"location":"user_guide/","text":"User Guide Now that you have the library installed, it's time to start to generate some code.
